# CGPA Calculator with Grade Validation

## Project Description
This project is a web-based application designed to calculate the SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) for students. It features grade validation, ensuring that only valid grades are entered for subjects, and calculates the grades and cumulative scores for Semesters 5 and 6. The application provides an interactive interface for users to input grades and instantly view their SGPA, CGPA, and cumulative grade points.

## Features
- **Grade Validation**: Ensures input grades are valid (e.g., EX, AA, AB, etc.).
- **Dynamic Grade Point Calculation**: Computes SGPA and CGPA based on subject-specific credits.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user for invalid inputs.
- **Real-Time Results**: Displays SGPA, CGPA, and cumulative grade points for each semester.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for grade point calculations and validation.
